# Accelerometer_KL05z_SMP



Goal
===
Project is a part of pass the Microprocessors Systems subject.

Description
===
A simple Accelerometer tool, that lets us check if  "vehicle" is accelerating or braking.
Whole project is write in C language, in Keil Unvision IDE, we are using a KL05z development platform enabled by the Kinetis® L Series KL0x MCU family built on the Arm® Cortex®-M0+ processor. In This project is used a LED RGB DIODE(Green - Accelerating, Red - Braking).
The main task to face will be, to receive the DATA from device, to discover if "vehicle" is accelerating of braking. After that, program's functions will be responsible for to blink RED or GREEN LED RGB DIODE.
